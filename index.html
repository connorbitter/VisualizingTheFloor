            <p>On October 28, 2014, ESPN released its 2014-2015 preseason NBA predictions, with 28 analysts submitting their pick for the team most likely to bring home the Larry O'Brien trophy in June.  The favorite, earning 50% of the votes?  The Cleveland Cavaliers, led by LeBron James in his first season since returning home.  The Cavs did the reach the Finals but would not prevail, falling in 5 games in the Golden State Warriors.  Despite receiving only a single pre-season vote from ESPN's panel, the Warriors revolutionized the NBA in 2014-2015, capturing the franchise's first championship and laying the groundwork for the most dominant 3-year regular season stretch in NBA history.  After years of toiling in obscurity and languishing in the Bay, these Warriors took the league by storm.  Who were they, and how did they do it?</p>

            <h1>Interactive Shot Chart</h1>
            <p>While the 2014-2015 Warriors will be remembered for a variety of reasons, they are perhaps best known for deadly shooting acumen.  Dubbed the "Splash Brothers" because of their prowess from deep, Golden State's starting backcourt of Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson combined to knock down 525 3-pointers over the course of the season, smashing their own record of 484 from the year before.  In the coming years, this 3-point barrage would sweep across the league, as teams and players became smarter with their shot selection, stepping behind the arc and trading in efficient long 2-point shots for more valuable 3s.</p>
            <p>Using a combination the NBA's API and Kaggle datasets, we were able to determine the location from which over 110,000 shots were taken during the 2014-2015 season.  This information, grouped by team and player, can be found below, and although representing incomplete data, it does show the beginning of shot stratification across the league, as a high concentration of attempts come either at the rim or from 3.</p>

            <h1>Defender Distance</h1>

            <p>The Warriors' ball movement was (and continues to be) awe-inspiring, and it resulted in some of the league's best shooters getting more open shots than most other teams. But does it matter how open a player is when he's shooting? Let's take a look.</p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-12">
            <p>We observe marked improvement in 3-point shooting as the defender moves farther away, meaning that the shooter has a cleaner look at the basket upon release.  This intuitively makes sense; contested shots should be more difficult, and this assumption is confirmed by our data.  We find no such trend in 2-point shots, which is somewhat surprising.  Although we have no definitive explanation, we hypothesize that the effect of defender distance may be masked because we fail to control for shot type.  For instance, a highly contested layup from 2 feet may actually be converted at a higher rate than a wide-open jumper from 18 feet.  Thus, the negative impact of taking a shot closer to defenders may be neutralized by the positive impact of driving to the rim.</p>

            <h1>Catch and Shoot?</h1>

            <p>Ball movement creates open looks, and open looks means more catch and shoot (and less isolation).  Ideally, shots taken immediately after receiving a pass should be wide open, as the defense is forced to react as the ball moves. Is this more efficient? Let's look.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-12">
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-lg-6">

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-12">

            <p>On 3-point shots, we do see a small bump in shooting percentage if the player has held the ball for only about a second.  This does seem to align with conventional wisdom; the fastest releases in the NBA have been tracked at about 0.75 seconds, so we suspect that this improvement may in fact represent catch-and-shoot opportunities.  However, this shot is rather small, and we can't draw any definitive conclusions.  For 2-point field goals, our results are muddled and show very high variance.  The incredibly high FG% after very short touches almost certainly represents put-back opportunities, meaning that an offensive player collects a rebound at the rim and immediately tips it in.  Although these are converted at an exceptioinally high rate, they don't represent the true catch-and-shoot chances that we hoped to investigate.</p>

            <h1>Shot Clock?</h1>

              <p>Players are often told to use the shot clock to their advantage, allowing the time remaining to tick down as they search for the best open look they can find within these 24 precious seconds.  Is this really the optimal strategy?</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-12">

          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-12">

              <p>It seems that our answer is both yes and no.  On both 2-point and 3-point field goals, we see a marked decrease in FG% as the shot clock drops below 1 second remaining.  This makes sense; at this point, the defense knows that the ballhandler must put up a shot to avoid a turnover, and he can tightly contest the attempt.  On 2-point attempts, we actually find that the most efficient shots take place in the first 4 seconds of the shot clock.  We suspect that this can be explained by fastbreak opportunities; after the defense forces a turnover, they can often run in the open court with a man advantage, easily getting to the rim and converting uncontested layups and dunks very quickly.</p>

            <p>We suspect that better teams create more open shots, and that this effect will be observable in the average closest defender distance at the time of their field goal attempts.  We haven't had time to label this visualization or really investigate it yet, but we hope that the shorter bars will represent better teams, supporting our hypothesis.</p>
